= USIC - Unibus Storage and I/O Card

The USIC is a Unibus card with an FPGA and SD cards that emulates the old DEC disk
controllers and drives.

This repository is the KiCad project for the hardware, the USIC board
itself.  In addition there are separate projects for a
http://github.com/dabridgham/QSIC[QBUS] version of the board, the
QSIC, the http://github.com/dabridgham/QSIC-Verilog[Verilog code] that
runs on the FPGAs, and the code that runs on the embedded soft
processor (not yet started).

A companion http://github.com/dabridgham/Indicator-Panel[indicator
panel] is also available for those who want the blinkenlights.
